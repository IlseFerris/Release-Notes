New scripts
===
### ACTIONS SCRIPTS
**LTC - ICF-DD DEDUCTION FIATER**
New script will FIAT earned income disregards on STAT/WKEX for LTC clients in ICF-DD's that receive earned income. Deductions will be FIATed for a selected month through the active budget period. *Completed by May Xiong (@mxiong1, Ramsey County) and Ilse Ferris (@IlseFerris, Hennepin County). Resolves issue #2057.*

===
### BULK SCRIPTS
**BANKED MONTHS REPORT**
New script to create a report for submitting used Banked Months to DHS. This script will take a list from a specific Excel File of client data to review for reporting. The script then:
  1. Uses the case number and client name to confirm the correct client is found'
  2. Gathers the PMI
  3. Checks ELIG to ensure SNAP was open for this client in the report month
  4. Confirms SNAP was not prorated
  5. Checks for some basic ABAWD exemptions in the report month
  6. Reviews WREG to ensure it is coded correctly
  7. Counts the Initial ABAWD counted months and creates a list of these months
  8. Counts the 2nd Pd of ABAWD months (if used) and creates a list of these months
  9. If Requested, adds a Person Note to document the Banked Month being reported

With all of this detail the script adds all of the relevant information to the specific Excel file with the DHS report data for any client that still appears to have used a Banked Month in the report month. A second report will be created to detail any client not added to the DHS report, along with the reasons why this client was not added. 

This script requires a specific format of the Excel Files. The templates are available and should be saved in a local file location.

*Completed by Casey Love (@C-Love, Ramsey County) and Ilse Ferris (@IlseFerris, Hennepin County). Resolves issue #2146.*
