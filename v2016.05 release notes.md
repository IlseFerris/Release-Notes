### NOTES SCRIPTS
**CLOSED PROGRAMS**
Did a general update of the script which includes the following...

1. Added informative text to the dialog box.
2. Tightened/cleaned up the dialog box for easier readability.
3. Added navigation buttons to the Insurance Affordability and Health Care Program manuals to the dialog box.
4. Removed functionality related the health care REIN dates from the script.
5. Added information to the end script message box regarding removal of HC REIN information.
6. Updated logic around future intake dates that became a bug when scripts were updated.

*Completed by Laura Larson (@LaLarson, Olmsted County). Resolves issue #2076.*

**DENIED PROGRAMS**
This update prevents the script from duplicating the reason for "Coding for denial" when case noting. *Completed by Robert Fewins-Kalb (@RobertFewins-Kalb, Anoka County). Resolves issue #2141.*

Functions Library (FuncLib) updates (for scriptwriters)
===
### Updated functions
**get_county_code**
`worker_county_code_determination` has been depreciated, and a new simplified function called `get_county_code` has replaced it. Scriptwriters should use `get_county_code` any time county-specific functionality (such as x1 numbers, custom addresses, or custom dialogs) is implemented. *Completed by Veronica Cary (@theVKC, DHS). Resolves FuncLib issue #208.*

**script_end_procedure**
The `script_end_procedure` has a new feature - if `disable_StopScript` is set to `true`, the function will keep running and not stop the script, allowing chain-loading with ease. *Completed by Veronica Cary (@theVKC, DHS). Resolves FuncLib issue #205.*
