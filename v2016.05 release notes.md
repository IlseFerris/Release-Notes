New scripts

### NOTICES SCRIPTS
**ELIGIBILITY NOTIFIER**
This script will send a SPEC/MEMO to the client to notify them of potential eligibility for MA, MSP, MNSure, SNAP, or cash programs. It also contains information regarding how to apply, and CAF1 importance. *Completed by Charles Potter (@CDPotter, Anoka County). Resolves issue #2153.*

**MA INMATE APPLICATION WCOM**
Adds a SPEC/WCOM to an MA approval notice to inform clients who have applied for MA (while in the process of being released from a correctional facility) of their MA start date. This start date is determined by trying to read the FACI panel for a release date. *Completed by Charles Potter (@CDPotter, Anoka County). Resolves issue #2148.*

4. Removed functionality related the health care REIN dates from the script.

Functions Library (FuncLib) updates (for scriptwriters)
===
### Updated functions
**get_county_code**
`worker_county_code_determination` has been depreciated, and a new simplified function called `get_county_code` has replaced it. Scriptwriters should use `get_county_code` any time county-specific functionality (such as x1 numbers, custom addresses, or custom dialogs) is implemented. *Completed by Veronica Cary (@theVKC, DHS). Resolves FuncLib issue #208.*

**script_end_procedure**
The `script_end_procedure` has a new feature - if `disable_StopScript` is set to `true`, the function will keep running and not stop the script, allowing chain-loading with ease. *Completed by Veronica Cary (@theVKC, DHS). Resolves FuncLib issue #205.*

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Other updates
===
**SETTINGS - GLOBAL VARIABLES.vbs**
The `county_name` variable was removed from Global Variables, as the new function `get_county_code` determines this programmatically. *Completed by Veronica Cary (@theVKC, DHS). Resolves issue #2145.*
