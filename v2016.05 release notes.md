New scripts
===
### BULK SCRIPTS
**BANKED MONTHS REPORT**
New script to create a report for submitting used Banked Months to DHS. This script will take a list from a specific Excel File of client data to review for reporting. The script then:
  1. Uses the case number and client name to confirm the correct client is found'
  2. Gathers the PMI
  3. Checks ELIG to ensure SNAP was open for this client in the report month
  4. Confirms SNAP was not prorated
  5. Checks for some basic ABAWD exemptions in the report month
  6. Reviews WREG to ensure it is coded correctly
  7. Counts the Initial ABAWD counted months and creates a list of these months
  8. Counts the 2nd Pd of ABAWD months (if used) and creates a list of these months
  9. If Requested, adds a Person Note to document the Banked Month being reported

With all of this detail the script adds all of the relevant information to the specific Excel file with the DHS report data for any client that still appears to have used a Banked Month in the report month. A second report will be created to detail any client not added to the DHS report, along with the reasons why this client was not added. 

This script requires a specific format of the Excel Files. The templates are available and should be saved in a local file location.

*Completed by Casey Love (@C-Love, Ramsey County) and Ilse Ferris (@IlseFerris, Hennepin County). Resolves issue #2146.*

### NOTICES SCRIPTS
**ELIGIBILITY NOTIFIER**
This script will send a SPEC/MEMO to the client to notify them of potential eligibility for MA, MSP, MNSure, SNAP, or cash programs. It also contains information regarding how to apply, and CAF1 importance. *Completed by Charles Potter (@CDPotter, Anoka County). Resolves issue #2153.*

**MA INMATE APPLICATION WCOM**
Adds a SPEC/WCOM to an MA approval notice to inform clients who have applied for MA (while in the process of being released from a correctional facility) of their MA start date. This start date is determined by trying to read the FACI panel for a release date. *Completed by Charles Potter (@CDPotter, Anoka County). Resolves issue #2148.*

Scripts retired in this release

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Functions Library (FuncLib) updates (for scriptwriters)
===
### Updated functions
**get_county_code**
`worker_county_code_determination` has been depreciated, and a new simplified function called `get_county_code` has replaced it. Scriptwriters should use `get_county_code` any time county-specific functionality (such as x1 numbers, custom addresses, or custom dialogs) is implemented. *Completed by Veronica Cary (@theVKC, DHS). Resolves FuncLib issue #208.*

**script_end_procedure**
The `script_end_procedure` has a new feature - if `disable_StopScript` is set to `true`, the function will keep running and not stop the script, allowing chain-loading with ease. *Completed by Veronica Cary (@theVKC, DHS). Resolves FuncLib issue #205.*

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Other updates
===
**SETTINGS - GLOBAL VARIABLES.vbs**
The `county_name` variable was removed from Global Variables, as the new function `get_county_code` determines this programmatically. *Completed by Veronica Cary (@theVKC, DHS). Resolves issue #2145.*
