New scripts
===
### ACTIONS SCRIPTS
**LTC - ICF-DD DEDUCTION FIATER**
New script will FIAT earned income disregards on STAT/WKEX for LTC clients in ICF-DD's that receive earned income. Deductions will be FIATed for a selected month through the active budget period. *Completed by May Xiong (@mxiong1, Ramsey County) and Ilse Ferris (@IlseFerris, Hennepin County). Resolves issue #2057.*

===
### BULK SCRIPTS
**BANKED MONTHS REPORT**
New script to create a report for submitting used Banked Months to DHS. This script will take a list from a specific Excel File of client data to review for reporting. The script then:
  1. Uses the case number and client name to confirm the correct client is found'
  2. Gathers the PMI
  3. Checks ELIG to ensure SNAP was open for this client in the report month
  4. Confirms SNAP was not prorated
  5. Checks for some basic ABAWD exemptions in the report month
  6. Reviews WREG to ensure it is coded correctly
  7. Counts the Initial ABAWD counted months and creates a list of these months
  8. Counts the 2nd Pd of ABAWD months (if used) and creates a list of these months
  9. If Requested, adds a Person Note to document the Banked Month being reported

With all of this detail the script adds all of the relevant information to the specific Excel file with the DHS report data for any client that still appears to have used a Banked Month in the report month. A second report will be created to detail any client not added to the DHS report, along with the reasons why this client was not added. 

This script requires a specific format of the Excel Files. The templates are available and should be saved in a local file location.

*Completed by Casey Love (@C-Love, Ramsey County) and Ilse Ferris (@IlseFerris, Hennepin County). Resolves issue #2146.*

===
### NOTICES SCRIPTS
**ELIGIBILITY NOTIFIER**
This script will send a SPEC/MEMO to the client to notify them of potential eligibility for MA, MSP, MNSure, SNAP, or cash programs. It also contains information regarding how to apply, and CAF1 importance. *Completed by Charles Potter (@CDPotter, Anoka County). Resolves issues #2153, #2151, and #2171.*

**MA INMATE APPLICATION WCOM**
Adds a SPEC/WCOM to an MA approval notice to inform clients who have applied for MA (while in the process of being released from a correctional facility) of their MA start date. This start date is determined by trying to read the FACI panel for a release date. *Completed by Charles Potter (@CDPotter, Anoka County). Resolves issues #2148 and #2219.*

### UPDATED FUNCTIONS

Fixed bug in function that outputs ABAWD information into scripts such as NOTES - CAF and NOTES - CSR.

Also updated `script_end_procedure` to bypass the closing message if being used in scripts where it comes from `cancel_confirmation`. *Completed by Ilse Ferris (@IlseFerris, Hennepin County). Resolves FuncLib issue #211.*

Resolves FuncLib issue #208.*

**income_test_SNAP_categorically_elig**

Other updates
===
**BULK - BULK SCRIPT TEMPLATE.vbs**
A template for scriptwriters to use as a starting point for developing custom bulk scripts has been completed. *Completed by David Courtright (@courtrightd, St. Louis County). Resolves issue #2167.*

**OLD MAIN MENU SCRIPTS**
Three old MAIN MENU scripts (MEMOS, NOTES 0-G, and NOTES H-Z) have had depreciation notices added. Users seeing these pop-ups should ask a scripts administrator to update their scripts with the latest version immediately. Access to these old main menus expires in the June release. *Completed by Veronica Cary (@theVKC, DHS). Resolves issue #2193.*

**REDIRECT - NOTES H-Z.vbs**
An old redirect file was removed. End users should not notice any issues with this. *Completed by Veronica Cary (@theVKC, DHS). Resolves issue #2208.*

**SETTINGS - GLOBAL VARIABLES.vbs**
The `county_name` variable was removed from Global Variables, as the new function `get_county_code` determines this programmatically. *Completed by Veronica Cary (@theVKC, DHS). Resolves issue #2145.*

**ALL SCRIPTS**
The following functions were depreciated across all scripts:

* `ERRR_screen_check` was integrated into other functions and is no longer supported
* `maxis_check_function` has become `check_for_MAXIS`
* `navigate_to_screen` has become `navigate_to_MAXIS_screen`
* `write_editbox_in_case_note` has become `write_bullet_and_variable_in_CASE_NOTE`
* `write_new_line_in_case_note` has become `write_variable_in_CASE_NOTE`
* `write_new_line_in_SPEC_MEMO` has become `write_variable_in_SPEC_MEMO`
* `worker_county_code_determination` has become `get_county_code`
* `write_TIKL_function` has become `write_variable_in_TIKL`

In addition, in order to meet feature parity with the separate (and county-driven-not-state-supported) PRISM script project, several MAXIS-specific variables were renamed:

* `case_number` has become `MAXIS_case_number`
* `footer_month` has become `MAXIS_footer_month`
* `footer_year` has become `MAXIS_footer_year`

Finally, the Functions Library block and statistics block were updated to take up less space and be cleaner code-wise.

They were removed (or renamed) from the primary script directory, and modified in Functions Library to generate a pop-up box if they are invoked. End users should not notice any changes because of this, aside from any county-specific scripts that use these depreciated functions. Scriptwriters experiencing these functions should update them immediately. *Completed by Veronica Cary (@theVKC, DHS). Resolves issues #2195 and #1938, as well as FuncLib issues #71, #106, and #184.*
