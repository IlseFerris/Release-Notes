About this release
===
This release of BlueZone Scripts is a small release which includes a few new helpful tools, including a neat new PRISM Screen Finder for MAXIS users built by Wendy LeVesseur, a Child Support worker from Anoka County. Scriptwriters statewide spent much of this release cycle working on major projects expected in the next few months, including new workflow scripts and updates to popular scripts such as CAF and the DAIL Scrubber.

BlueZone Scripts are automatically updated via GitHub, without requiring any changes to files installed locally for counties and agencies. If you appear to be missing some of these updates, consider re-installing your scripts. Contact Veronica.Cary@state.mn.us with any additional questions.

It is recommended that supervisors review these notes with staff. A PDF version of these notes is included below.

New scripts
===
### ACTIONS SCRIPTS
**HOUSING GRANT MONY/CHCK ISSUANCE**
This is a new script for MFIP housing grant cases that should have been issued in prior months. This script will ensure that an issuance has not already occurred for the case and month selected, and will complete the MONY/CHCK per the instructions in the Housing grant bulletin, and will case note the action. *Completed by Ilse Ferris (@IlseFerris, Hennepin County). Resolves issue #2081.*

===
### BULK SCRIPTS
**HOUSING GRANT EXEMPTION FINDER**
This is a new script that creates a list of the rolling 12 months of housing grant issuances for MFIP recipients who've met an exemption. *Completed by Ilse Ferris (@IlseFerris, Hennepin County). Resolves issue #2001.*

**TARGETED SNAP REVIEW SELECTION**
This is a new script that will allow agencies to select SNAP cases for internal review based on specific criteria to help identify error-prone cases. Selects both PAR (ACTIVE) and CAPER (closed/denied) cases for review. The script collects cases off REPT/ACTV and REPT/INAC and adds those cases meeting selection criteria to a spreadsheet. Once the lists have been built, it selects at random the specified number of each review type and adds them to a new sheet to be assigned for review. *Completed by David Courtright (@courtrightd, St. Louis County). Resolves issue #2093.*

===
### NOTES SCRIPTS

Script for case noting details about a deceased client. *Completed by Ann Sunderman (@asunderman, Le Sueur County). Resolves issue #2054.*

### NOTICES SCRIPTS
**BANKED MONTHS WCOMS**
Adds WCOMS based on selection from 3 options:
* All banked months used
  * _"You have been receiving SNAP banked months. Your SNAP is closing for using all available banked months. If you meet one of the exemptions listed above AND all other eligibility factors you may still be eligible for SNAP. Please contact your financial worker if you have questions."_
* Banked months notifier
  * _"You have used all of your available ABAWD months. You may be eligible for SNAP banked months if you are cooperating with Employment services. Please contact your financial worker if you have questions."_
* Closing for E/T non-coop 
  * _"You have been receiving SNAP banked months. Your SNAP case is closing because CLIENT NAME did not meet requirements of working with Employment and Training. If you feel you have Good Cause for not cooperating with this requirement please contact your financial worker before your SNAP closes. If your SNAP closes for not cooperating with Employment and Training you will not be eligible for future banked months. If you meet an exemption listed about AND all other eligibility factors you may still be eligible for SNAP. Please contact your financial worker if you have questions."_
  
  *Completed by Charles Potter (@CDPotter, Anoka County). Resolves issue #2039.*
  
**VERIFICATIONS STILL NEEDED**
This script is meant to be used when several verifications have been received from the client but there is still outstanding information needed to determine eligibility. It will case note all outstanding information entered in to the script and then open a Word document, and list the information there as well to be sent out to the client, informing them that more information is still needed. *Completed by Laura Larson (@LaLarson, Olmsted County). Resolves issue #2060.*

At the screen, press F1 in the case number, or MCI number field to search for and select the participant whose information you would like to see. *Completed by Wendy LeVesseur (@levesswe, Anoka County).
