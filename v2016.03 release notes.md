### DAIL Scrubber scripts
**Citizenship Verified**

Resolves issue #1967.*

**New Hire** and **New Hire NDNH**

When this happens the script will now give you a pop-up to alert the worker to check the next footer month. *Completed by Mel Fox (@MelissaFox-Stearns, Stearns County). Resolves issue #1821.*
