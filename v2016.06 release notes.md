<<INFO ABOUT THE RELEASE WILL GO HERE>>

BlueZone Scripts are automatically updated via GitHub, without requiring any changes to files installed locally for counties and agencies. If you appear to be missing some of these updates, consider re-installing your scripts. Contact Veronica.Cary@state.mn.us with any additional questions.

It is recommended that supervisors review these notes with staff. A PDF version of these notes is included below.

Updates to existing scripts

### ACTIONS SCRIPTS
**ABAWD FSET EXEMPTION CHECK**
Reworking verbiage to better follow policy (Combined Manual citation: 0028.06.12).

Please review for ABAWD and SNAP E&T exemptions." rather than not mentioning working 30 hours a week. *Completed by Charles Potter (@CDPotter, Anoka County). Resolves issue #2270.*

**MAIN MENU**
The Utilities menu button has been removed from the Actions main menu, as it is now on its own button on the Power Pad. Also, an incorrect reference to Notices scripts was replaced. *Completed by Veronica Cary (@theVKC, DHS). Resolves issues #2288 and #2268.*

===
### DAIL SCRUBBER SCRIPTS
**ABAWD FSET EXEMPTION CHECK**
Reworking verbiage to better follow policy (Combined Manual citation: 0028.06.12).

===
### NOTES SCRIPTS
**APPLICATION RECEIVED**
A bug was fixed in the functions library that was causing a single digit for MAXIS footer month (causing the script to enter the footer month into the wrong space in the footer month field), it will now correctly enter the two digit standard for scripts for the MAXIS footer month. *Completed by Casey Love (@C-Love, Ramsey County). Resolves FuncLib issue #232.*

**BURIAL ASSETS**
You can now list specific items and/or services as being applied to the BFE. This will then be calculated and displayed in detail on the case note. Also added alternative container to Burial space/items list. Added luncheon, and medical exam fee to cash advance items. *Completed by Charles Potter (@CDPotter, Anoka County). Resolves issue #2245.*

**LTC - ASSET ASSESSMENT**
The `EMReadScreen` function was accidentally written as `EMReadScreacen` when reading marital assets, causing an impassable error. Corrected the spelling of the function. *Completed by Ilse Ferris (@IlseFerris, Hennepin County). Resolves issue #2285.*

**LTC - COLA SUMMARY 2016**
The script can now enter the month the worker chooses, rather than being limited to one approval month per COLA cycle. The name of this script has been changed to **LTC - COLA SUMMARY** as a result. *Completed by Charles Potter (@CDPotter, Anoka County). Resolves issue #2276.*
