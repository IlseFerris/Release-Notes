<<INFO ABOUT THE RELEASE WILL GO HERE>>

BlueZone Scripts are automatically updated via GitHub, without requiring any changes to files installed locally for counties and agencies. If you appear to be missing some of these updates, consider re-installing your scripts. Contact Veronica.Cary@state.mn.us with any additional questions.

It is recommended that supervisors review these notes with staff. A PDF version of these notes is included below.

Updates to existing scripts
===
### ACTIONS SCRIPTS
**ABAWD FSET EXEMPTION CHECK**
Reworking verbiage to better follow policy (Combined Manual citation: 0028.06.12). It will now read: "appears to be working 30 hours/wk (regardless of wage level) or earning equivalent of 30 hours/wk at federal minimum wage. Please review for ABAWD and SNAP E&T exemptions." rather than not mentioning working 30 hours a week. *Completed by Charles Potter (@CDPotter, Anoka County). Resolves issue #2270.*

**HOUSING GRANT MONY CHCK ISSUANCE**
This script name was too long. Renamed the script to **ACTIONS - HG SUPPLEMENT**. *Completed by Ilse Ferris (@IlseFerris, Hennepin County). Resolves issue #2291.*

**TRANSFER CASE**
Updated to notify worker if SPEC/MEMO is unable to be accessed. Added verbiage to include this could be because the worker does not have authorization to send a SPEC/MEMO. Script originally only had a message that the worker could be in inquiry mode. *Completed by Mel Fox (@MelissaFox-Stearns, Stearns County). Resolves issue #2269.*

**MAIN MENU**
The Utilities menu button has been removed from the Actions main menu, as it is now on its own button on the Power Pad. Also, an incorrect reference to Notices scripts was replaced. *Completed by Veronica Cary (@theVKC, DHS). Resolves issues #2288 and #2268.*

Enhancement to the script that will include the total case counts for workers to the report, since these are different from the program based counts. *Completed by Casey Love (@C-Love, Ramsey County). Resolves issue #2131.*

A variable has been updated to look for an entire case number rather than one digit, eliminating missed cases on this bulk list. *Completed by Travis Farleigh (@Farleight, Carlton County). Resolves issue #2258.*

**REPT-REVS LIST**
A variable has been updated to look for an entire case number rather than one digit, eliminating missed cases on this bulk list. *Completed by Travis Farleigh (@Farleight, Carlton County). Resolves issue #2258.*

Script will now correctly case note MAGI reinstate dates. *Completed by Charles Potter (@CDPotter, Anoka County). Resolves issue #2265.*

**TARGETED SNAP REVIEW SELECTION**
The script will now only select active cases that have had a SNAP approval in current month minus one, to align with review month for CAPER cases. *Completed by David Courtright (@courtrightd, St. Louis County). Resolves issue #2262.*

===
### DAIL SCRUBBER SCRIPTS

Resolves FuncLib issue #232.*

**BURIAL ASSETS**
