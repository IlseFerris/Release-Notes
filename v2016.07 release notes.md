BlueZone Scripts are automatically updated via GitHub, without requiring any changes to files installed locally for counties and agencies. If you appear to be missing some of these updates, consider re-installing your scripts. Contact Veronica.Cary@state.mn.us with any additional questions.

It is recommended that supervisors review these notes with staff. A PDF version of these notes is included below.

Updates to existing scripts
===
### ACTIONS SCRIPTS
Fixes a typo in the case note that lists 1st Quarter twice. *Completed by Casey Love (@C-Love, Ramsey County). Resolves issue #2384.*

===
### BULK SCRIPTS
Script will now correctly loop through case number rather than getting stuck on last case number case/noted on. *Completed by Charles Potter (@CDPotter, Anoka County). Resolves issue #2389.*

===
### NOTES SCRIPTS
**BURIAL ASSETS**
A few updates to this script, which now has better functionality regarding calculation for specific assets:
* A dynamic calculator that displays current totals for counted assets and assets applied to the BFE. When the user hits a button the calculator will refresh, it will also make sure the user doesn't enter more than $1500 into the BFE and appropriately relabel the last item to push the BFE over $1500 to BFE/counted (it will also let the user know of this change and inform them to review it). This is more in line with examples found in LTC training case notes.
* A preview messagebox has been added after the user enters all of the information. This box will display the totals, what items were selected, what their items values are, and what the status of the item is (counted excluded etc). User can then go back to change things, quit, or go to case note.
* For scriptwriters: some old outdated functions were cleaned up, pulling 3 out of the functions library, and case noting procedures cleaned up as well.

*Completed by Charles Potter (@CDPotter, Anoka County). Resolves issue #2343.*

**CLIENT CONTACT**
Added field for MNSURE/IC number to the dialog. This will be added to case note if used. *Completed by Kenny Lee (@kennyasalee, Ramsey County). Resolves issue #2379.*

**DENIED PROGRAMS**
End message verbiage will now correctly state if a TIKL was created. *Completed by Charles Potter (@CDPotter, Anoka County). Resolves issue #2374.*
