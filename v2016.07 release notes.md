<<INFO ABOUT THE RELEASE WILL GO HERE>>

BlueZone Scripts are automatically updated via GitHub, without requiring any changes to files installed locally for counties and agencies. If you appear to be missing some of these updates, consider re-installing your scripts. Contact Veronica.Cary@state.mn.us with any additional questions.

It is recommended that supervisors review these notes with staff. A PDF version of these notes is included below.

New scripts

### ACTIONS SCRIPTS
**ACCT PANEL UPDATER**
This script will either add a new ACCT panel to MAXIS or update an existing ACCT panel. It can be ran multiple times to either add/update multiple ACCT panels in any combination of add/update. It will then case note all actions upon completion of the script. *Completed by Tim Delong (@StormageddonDLOA, Stearns County). Resolves issue #2109.*

Updates to existing scripts
===
### ACTIONS SCRIPTS
Fixes a typo in the case note that lists 1st Quarter twice. *Completed by Casey Love (@C-Love, Ramsey County). Resolves issue #2384.*

===
### BULK SCRIPTS
Script will now correctly loop through case number rather than getting stuck on last case number case/noted on. *Completed by Charles Potter (@CDPotter, Anoka County). Resolves issue #2389.*

===
### NOTES SCRIPTS
**BURIAL ASSETS**
A few updates to this script, which now has better functionality regarding calculation for specific assets:
* A dynamic calculator that displays current totals for counted assets and assets applied to the BFE. When the user hits a button the calculator will refresh, it will also make sure the user doesn't enter more than $1500 into the BFE and appropriately relabel the last item to push the BFE over $1500 to BFE/counted (it will also let the user know of this change and inform them to review it). This is more in line with examples found in LTC training case notes.
* A preview messagebox has been added after the user enters all of the information. This box will display the totals, what items were selected, what their items values are, and what the status of the item is (counted excluded etc). User can then go back to change things, quit, or go to case note.
* For scriptwriters: some old outdated functions were cleaned up, pulling 3 out of the functions library, and case noting procedures cleaned up as well.

*Completed by Charles Potter (@CDPotter, Anoka County). Resolves issue #2343.*

**CLIENT CONTACT**
Added field for MNSURE/IC number to the dialog. This will be added to case note if used. *Completed by Kenny Lee (@kennyasalee, Ramsey County). Resolves issue #2379.*

**DENIED PROGRAMS**
End message verbiage will now correctly state if a TIKL was created. *Completed by Charles Potter (@CDPotter, Anoka County). Resolves issue #2374.*

**MFIP SANCTION AND DWP DISQUALIFICATION**
Added the option to choose Dual Sanctions (CS & ES) type. Also changed sanction reason dropdown box to a combo box so the worker is able to type in a reason since dual sanctions will need to indicate two reasons. *Completed by Mel Fox (@MelissaFox-Stearns, Stearns County). Resolves issue #2418.*

===
### UTILITIES SCRIPTS
**TRAINING CASE CREATOR**
Enhancing the training case generator to better create content on PBEN. *Completed by Robert Fewins-Kalb (@RobertFewins-Kalb, Anoka County). Resolves FuncLib issue #264.*

===
### ALL SCRIPT UPDATES
**ABAWD months in case notes**
 If client hasn't used 2nd set of ABAWD months, the 2nd set number will register no months, and the verbiage about the second set months used will not be added to the edit box. Also, if client is a mandatory FSET participant (with an ABAWD counted month) and has not used any ABAWD months, the verbiage about the list of used months will not be added to the edit box. *Completed by Ilse Ferris (@IlseFerris, Hennepin County). Resolves FuncLib issue #262.*

Functions Library (FuncLib) updates (for scriptwriters)
===
### Updated functions
**script_end_procedure**
For stats-collecting agencies, the database connection will now explicitly close prior to exiting. End users should not notice any differences. Also, a "pass through" function was installed for scriptwriters. To create a message on the Access database without creating a corresponding pop-up, simply use `script_end_procedure("~PT: [message goes here]")`. The contents of the message will be passed through to the database without showing up as a pop-up. *Completed by Veronica Cary (@theVKC, DHS). Resolves FuncLib issues #217 and #257.*

**write_panel_to_MAXIS_ACCT**
Updating `write_panel_to_MAXIS_ACCT` to account for moving Account Balance Verification field. *Completed by Robert Fewins-Kalb (@RobertFewins-Kalb, Anoka County). Resolves FuncLib issue #245.*

**worker_signature**
The `worker_signature` determination was moved from Global Variables to FuncLib. *Completed by Veronica Cary (@theVKC, DHS). Resolves FuncLib issue #254.*

**OTHER FUNCTIONS**
Removed 3 functions that were only being used in the NOTES - BURIAL ASSETS script and didn't have any other functionality outside of that script: `new_BS_BSI_heading`, `new_CAI_heading`, and `new_service_heading`. *Completed by Charles Potter (@CDPotter, Anoka County). Resolves FuncLib issue #247.*
