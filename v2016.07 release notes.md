It is recommended that supervisors review these notes with staff. A PDF version of these notes is included below.

### NOTES SCRIPTS
**BURIAL ASSETS**
A few updates to this script, which now has better functionality regarding calculation for specific assets:
* A dynamic calculator that displays current totals for counted assets and assets applied to the BFE. When the user hits a button the calculator will refresh, it will also make sure the user doesn't enter more than $1500 into the BFE and appropriately relabel the last item to push the BFE over $1500 to BFE/counted (it will also let the user know of this change and inform them to review it). This is more in line with examples found in LTC training case notes.
* A preview messagebox has been added after the user enters all of the information. This box will display the totals, what items were selected, what their items values are, and what the status of the item is (counted excluded etc). User can then go back to change things, quit, or go to case note.
* For scriptwriters: some old outdated functions were cleaned up, pulling 3 out of the functions library, and case noting procedures cleaned up as well.

*Completed by Charles Potter (@CDPotter, Anoka County). Resolves issue #2343.*

**DENIED PROGRAMS**
End message verbiage will now correctly state if a TIKL was created. *Completed by Charles Potter (@CDPotter, Anoka County). Resolves issue #2374.*
