About this release
===
This is the February 2016 update for BlueZone Scripts. This release is a very large release, as it is the first release since a script freeze was lifted in January. We have several brand new scripts, including multiple scripts focusing on foster care for MAXIS workers. In addition, the "MEMOS" button has been replaced with a "NOTICES" button (accessible if you reinstall your scripts with the latest installer).

It is recommended that supervisors review these notes with staff. A PDF version of these notes is included below.
